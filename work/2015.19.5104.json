This emergency facility, which will admit people who are drunk, is sometimes referred to on the street as the \"Nightmare Center\" or \"Fright Center.\" There are no beds, so guests must sleep on chairs or on the floor. Linda sleeps under her wheelchair because she worries that someone might steal it.)",
