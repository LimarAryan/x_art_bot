  "title": "It's 3:00 a.m. No way to sleep. Imaginary bedbugs chewing at me. The air is oppressive, like being buried alive. The cries of asthmatic children sniffling, screaming, sleep-talking keeps me on edge. In semi-darkness I wander among the beds, seeing mothers wrapped around their babies, like bears in hibernation. In one lower bunk, I find an exhausted mother, Pam, rocking her wailing week-old daughter. Pams face glows with inner peace. She is one of the lucky ones. She escaped an abusive relationship and found shelter here. Olive Branch Mission, Chicago.",
