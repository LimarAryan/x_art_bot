Neal'd driven cross country and up-state to Dr. Leary's retreat at Millbrook N.Y. early in the Goldwater-Johnson Presidentiad. They'd come honking up the estate driveway to park by the big house Kesey & friends like a many-headed psychedelic loudspeaker'd rhinoceros in quiet woodlands recently raided by Assistant D.A. G. Gordon Liddy & local constabulary without search warrants looking for grass busts, L.S.D. still legal those years. Neal's scratching amphetamine itch in his driver's palm. Dr. Tim'd come outside to visit bus.",
