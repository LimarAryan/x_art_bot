  "title": "In the CARA job-training program, Margie is hungry for knowledge and eager to participate in her studies. She takes copious notes and never hesitates to ask questions. I can see her sense of self-worth returning. I was lucky to meet Margie at a time when she was ready to take control over her life. I spent time riding with her to CARA, and met many people in the same situation.
