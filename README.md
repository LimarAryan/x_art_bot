Using the National Gallery of Art's 
online open access for artwork images

Done through the 'work' folder
    'work' folder with JSON info provided by 
    Carnegie Mellon University with 100,000 
    crawled image sites from the National 
    Gallery of Art. The file can be found here, 
    and is called "nearest_neighbors.tar.gz":

This version runs in a local environment, 
however I am running the real
version on an aws lambda function, 
using an s3 bucket, and dynamodb.

I will do an in-depth write up later 😏🤩
